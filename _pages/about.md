Hi, I'm Selena. I am a post-bacc RA at MIT working with [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev). Here, I work on many projects related to language processing and representations in brains and LMs.

I am interested in how humans and machines understand and use language.

<!-- I am interested in how agents flexibly extract, encode, and represent meanings. What are the mechanisms and architectures that underlie intelligent communication? -->

<!-- How do we use language as a tool to process rich information?  -->

<!-- I have attempted these questions by 1) :brain: studying the language network in the brain, 2) :robot: evaluating, probing, and intervening on neural network language models, and 3) :woman: conducting behavioral experiments. Check out my [papers](https://selenashe.github.io/Publications/) for more! -->

Recently, I graduated from Haverford College with majors in Mathematics and Cognitive Science. I was also lucky to work with some wonderful mentors: [Benjamin Zinszer](https://benjaminz.com/) through my [senior thesis](https://www.swarthmore.edu/cognitive-science/academic-program), [Chris Potts](https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/) and [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/) through the [CSLI internship](https://csli.stanford.edu/csli-summer-internship-program-2024), and [Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com/) through the [REU-CAAR program](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/).
