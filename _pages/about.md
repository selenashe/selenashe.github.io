Hi, I’m Selena. I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where I am rotating with [Robert Hawkins](https://rdhawkins.com/), [Cory Shain](https://climblab.org/members/cory_shain), [Christopher Potts](https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/), and [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). I am grateful to be supported by a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf).

I am interested in how humans and machines understand and communicate with each other: How do we maintain common grounds and negotiate responsibilities in dialogues? To what extent do we rely on language in all this? I study this using tools from both artificial intelligence and cognitive (neuro)science.

Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a research assistant with [Ev Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/about-ev) at MIT. Before MIT, I graduated from Haverford College with majors in Mathematics and Cognitive Science. During undergrad, I interned at Stanford’s Center for the Study of Language and Information ([CSLI](https://csli.stanford.edu/csli-summer-internship-program-2024)) and UMD’s Program in Combinatorics and Algorithms for Real Problems ([REU-CAAR](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/)).

<!-- I am interested in how humans and machines communicate and collaborate, like how we understand meanings, share knowledge, and achieve goals together. To study this, I hope to bridge insights from artificial intelligence and cognitive science. -->

<!-- I am interested in how humans and machines use language to communicate and collaborate. How do words become shared meanings and coordinated actions? To study this, I want to combine tools and ideas from cognitive science (like brain imaging) and AI (like building agents or peeking inside neural nets). -->

<!-- Before coming to MIT, I graduated from Haverford College with majors in Mathematics and Cognitive Science. I was also lucky to work with some wonderful mentors: [Benjamin Zinszer](https://benjaminz.com/) through my [senior thesis](https://www.swarthmore.edu/cognitive-science/academic-program), [Chris Potts](https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/) and [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/) through the [CSLI internship](https://csli.stanford.edu/csli-summer-internship-program-2024), and [Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com/) through the [REU-CAAR program](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/).  -->
